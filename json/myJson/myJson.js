        "description" : "which was created as a result of the demerger of Rolls-Royce Limited in 1973. Vickers plc owned Rolls-Royce Motors between 1980 and 1998. Volkswagen AG acquired Rolls-Royce Motors in 1998 and renamed the firm Bentley Motors Limited in 2003. Bentley Motors Limited is the direct successor of Rolls-Royce Motors and its predecessor entities and owns historical Rolls-Royce assets such as the Crewe factory, pre-2003 vehicle designs and the L Series V8 engine."
